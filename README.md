# Bijou

This is a theme for [LaunchBar 6](https://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html) inspired by Vintage (also known as Small), the default theme for LaunchBar 5.

El Capitan Small differs from the Vintage theme in a number of ways. Mainly, the abbreviations font weight is bolder, there are no badges or accent colours when info browsing, and the text input background is colourless.

## Installation

Download [this repository as a .zip file](https://github.com/benjaminwil/el-capitan-small/archive/master.zip) and open the **El Capitan Small.lbtheme** file with LaunchBar. If you want to remove it in the future, you'll find the file in your **~/Library/Application Support/LaunchBar/Themes/** directory.

## Acknowledgements

This theme of course wouldn't be possible without [Objective Development](https://www.obdev.at) and LaunchBarâ€”and without access to Objective Development's own Base, Base Dark, and Vintage themes. Thanks! ðŸ¦€
